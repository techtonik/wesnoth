The bootstrap.py file can be used to build wesnoth on Windows OS.

Steps:

1. Install python 2.7. The default path is recommended, but if you must change it, make sure there are no space in the path.
2. Run the script by double-clicking it.
3. Choose the number of cores (processors) you wish to build boost and wesnoth with. It is recommended to have at least 500-700 megabytes of RAM free per core used.
4. When the script finishes, double-click on compile.cmd to build wesnoth.

This is all that is needed to build wesnoth.


There are two other .cmd files made by the bootstrap script. They are compile(debug-build) and debugger_launcher. These are used to make a backtrace. Backtraces can be useful in bug reports that involve wesnoth crashing. Otherwise, these files do not need to be run.

If a backtrace is needed, the files are used as follows:
1. Run compile(debug-build). This makes a debug build (wesnoth-debug.exe). The resulting .exe is approximately 1GB in size.
2. Run debugger_launcher.
3. When it's done reading symbols from wesnoth-debug.exe, type 'run'.
4. When wesnoth starts, take the steps needed to reproduce the crash.
5. when wesnoth stops responding, go back to the debugger window and type 'bt'.
6. Output will appear. wesnoth may still be running, so continue by typing 'cont'.
7. Repeat steps 5 & 6 until typing 'bt' gets the result of 'no stack'.
8. Right-click the command window, select 'Select All' and hit enter.
9. The contents of the command window are now in the clipboard, and can be pasted where needed.
